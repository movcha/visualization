# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  

Visualization 1: Python Visualization

Software Used:
- Python with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Intended Audience:
- Public health officials, environmental scientists, and the general public who are interested in the water quality of Toronto beaches.

Information or Message:
- The visualization aims to show the trends in E. Coli levels at various Toronto beach sites over the years. This information can help in understanding the long-term water quality and identifying any problematic sites that may need intervention.

Design Principles:
- The visualization focuses on meaningful data that can influence public health decisions.
- Different colors are used to represent varying levels of E. Coli to make the distinction clear and intuitive.
- The design is clean and uncluttered, with each beach site's data separated into individual small graphs for clarity.

The principles were applied by:
- Using a consistent color scheme to indicate E. Coli levels.
- Arranging the plots in a grid to facilitate easy comparison between different sites.
- Ensuring labels and titles are clear and informative.

Reproducibility:
- The code used to create the visualization is fully reproducible, as it includes all necessary steps from data loading to plotting.
- The use of standard libraries ensures that anyone with a Python environment can replicate the results.

Accessibility:
- The visualization uses color schemes that are colorblind-friendly.
- Titles and labels are used to ensure that even those with visual impairments can understand the data when using screen readers.

Impacted Individuals and Communities:
- Communities around Toronto beaches and public health stakeholders will be impacted by this visualization. It can inform them about water safety and potential health risks.

Feature Selection:
- I included the siteName, collectionDate, and eColi levels from the dataset. These features are directly relevant to assessing water quality over time at different locations.

Underwater Labour:
- Significant effort was put into data collection, cleaning, and ensuring the visualization adheres to best practices for accessibility and interpretability.

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
