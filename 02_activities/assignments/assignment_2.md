# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:


- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
```
      Good Visualization:
Annual COâ‚‚ emissions (Our World in Data)
Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?country=~OWID_WRL
- The visualization provides a clear and straightforward representation of global CO2 emissions over time. It uses a line chart with a well-defined y-axis and x-axis, making it easy to understand trends and compare data points.
- Different colors are used to differentiate between countries, which helps in visual distinction. The color scheme is not overwhelming and enhances comprehension.
- The interactive features allow users to explore data for specific countries and time periods, providing additional context and detail. This interactivity supports deeper analysis and engagement.


   Bad Visualization:
U.S. Debt Clock
Link: https://www.usdebtclock.org
- The visualization displays too many real-time counters and statistics simultaneously, making it difficult to focus on any single piece of information.
- The use of rapidly changing numbers and a cluttered layout makes it hard to interpret the data accurately.
Lack of Context: The visualization does not provide sufficient context or explanations for the data, leaving users confused about what the numbers represent.
- The visualization does not provide sufficient context or explanations for the data, leaving users confused about what the numbers represent.

```

- How could this data visualization have been improved?  
    
```
      Good Visualization: 
Annual COâ‚‚ emissions (Our World in Data)
Link: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?country=~OWID_WRL
- Including annotations or key events on the timeline could help users understand significant changes in CO2 emissions. For example, highlighting major international climate agreements or economic crises could add context.
- Incorporating data on CO2 emissions per capita or economic indicators could provide a more nuanced view of the emissions data, making it easier to assess performance relative to economic activity.


   Bad Visualization:
U.S. Debt Clock
Link: https://www.usdebtclock.org
- Reducing the number of displayed metrics and organizing them in a more structured layout would make the data easier to understand.
- Using static data points instead of rapidly changing numbers would improve readability.
- Including brief explanations or tooltips for each metric would help users understand the significance of the data.
```
  
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)


### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
